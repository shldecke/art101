			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this weeks lab was to create an array and an object in java script.  For the object, myMainRide,
						we had to give it attributes and a method and show that we know how to reference each of the attributes.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>There was a bit of playing around to get the desired output. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was very interesting! I learned that there is a difference between Java & JavaScript
						 and that's why things are done a wee bit differently here. ^^ </p>
