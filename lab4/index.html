			<h1>Lab 4 - pseudocode & problem solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab is to come up with pseudocode for a simple game and include it in our html file.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We struggled with finding a game and we had to ask for clarification on an instruction.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was straight forward. It went surprisingly smoothly. I put tired energy into the assignment.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output"></div>
					<pre><code>
					- Find an opponent
					- You challenge them
  						- You stand face to face with your opponent
					- You both make a fist with one hand
					- Both of you loudly and synchronously say “rock - paper - scissors” whilst simultaneously shaking your fist up and down
  						- While you're saying rock, paper, scissors, choose which option you’d like to display
					- Display your option at the end of “rock paper scissors”
					- Remember– rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock
					- First player to win 2 out of 3 games is the winner
