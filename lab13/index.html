					    <h2>Challenge</h2>
					    <p>The challenge of this lab is to use a create a FizzBuzz function using the newly learned for loop.
                            The idea is to loop through numbers 1-200 and output the number as well as key words "fizz", "buzz", 
                             "boom", or a combination of the three if a number is a multiple of 3, 5, or 7. 
                        </p>

                            <p>Professor had a really neat approach to this in class that made me rethink the way i want to approach this lab.
                                In the past i would have simply used nested for loops but i like the idea of combining the multiples instead. </p>
