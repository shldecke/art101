					    <h2>Challenge</h2>
					    <p>The challenge of this lab is to experiment with anonymous Functions
                        and callbacks.

                            <h2>Reflection</h2>
                            <p>I think this assignment really teaches us about to think about console output vs webpage output. I didn't realize 
                                things could be outputted in a console and not the document. I think I put in decent work. I was able to personally
                            style my page in 2 columns. </p>
